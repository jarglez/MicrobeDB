=head1 Name

delete_version.pl - Removes a MicrobeDB version.

=head1 USAGE

delete_version.pl [-a -f -n -d -l <log config> -h] [<version_id>]

#No interactive prompt to confirm deletion

delete_version.pl -n -d 23

=head1 OPTIONS

=item B<-d, --delete_files>

Removes files associated with this version in addition to data in the database. 

=item B<-f, --force>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<delete_version.pl> This script removes versions from MicrobeDB. MicrobeDB stores each update of downloaded files with a unique version id. Versions may need to be removed manually if an update failed or manual clean up is required. Old versions are deleted automatically by download_load_and_delete_old_version.pl.
Note that if a version has been "saved" by using "save_version.pl", then it will not be deleted unless --force option is used.
